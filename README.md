# Git tutorial

This website was created as a support document for a hands-on training session I hosted for young researchers from my group.
It was originally deployed as `neutrinoceros.github.io`, and is now found at [https://neutrinoceros.github.io/sherpiades-git-tutorial/](https://neutrinoceros.github.io/sherpiades-git-tutorial/).
